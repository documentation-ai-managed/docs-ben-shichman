  <Expandable title="What is a fractional CTO?" default-open="true">
    A fractional CTO from Summit Trail acts as your part-time technology leader. You gain access to Ben Shichman's 20+ years of experience in scaling startups and enterprises without the overhead of a full-time executive hire.

    Unlike consultants, fractional CTOs embed deeply in your team. Ben advises on architecture decisions, team building, vendor selection, and execution roadmaps. Engagement typically ranges from 10-30 hours per week, scaling with your needs.

    This model suits companies at Series A-C or those modernizing legacy systems, delivering high-impact leadership at a fraction of the cost.
  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="What is the typical timeline for seeing results?">
    You see initial value within the first 30 days. Ben conducts a tech audit and delivers a prioritized roadmap.

    Measurable outcomes like improved deployment speed or reduced tech debt appear in 60-90 days. Full transformations, such as migrating to microservices, take 3-6 months depending on scope.

    Track progress with weekly check-ins and shared OKRs.
